## Enforcement Mapping 

Maps each threat from `threat_model.md` to the layer that can enforce a
control, determines OPA scope, and produces `owasp_policy_guidelines.md`.
Requires `architecture.md` and `threat_model.md` in the target directory.

### Authoritative Paths

**Inputs:** Use ONLY these exact files. Do NOT read similarly-named files
from other folders. If a required file is missing here, stop and ask; do
not substitute one from elsewhere.
- Input 1: `<TARGET_AGENT_PATH>/smith/guidelines-security-analysis/architecture.md`
- Input 2: `<TARGET_AGENT_PATH>/smith/guidelines-security-analysis/threat_model.md`
- Input 3: `src/smith/data/owasp_10_ai_catalog.json` — repo-relative, not
  per-target-agent. Source of the `mitigations` used to ground STEP 5's
  rule proposals for each ASI category.
- Output: `<TARGET_AGENT_PATH>/smith/guidelines-security-analysis/owasp_policy_guidelines.md`

### OPA Enforcement Boundary (non-negotiable)

OPA can enforce a control if and only if ALL of the following are true:

1. The tool call is intercepted BEFORE the tool executes
2. The relevant data is present as a structured field at interception time
3. The field comes from `input.name`, `input.arguments.*`, or
   `input.extensions.*`

OPA CANNOT enforce controls over:
- The LLM's internal reasoning or generation
- The content of the system prompt
- The tool's return value / response
- External service behaviour or response integrity
- Library or dependency trust
- Post-hoc output processing

If a threat cannot be addressed at tool-invocation time with structured
fields, it is out of OPA scope — even if it is a real and serious risk.

### Workflow (follow strictly)

---

#### STEP 1 — Read inputs

Read `architecture.md`, `threat_model.md`, and the `owasp_10_ai_catalog.json`
catalog in full before proceeding.
If a required file is missing, stop and tell the user which file is needed.

---

#### STEP 2 — Per-threat enforcement mapping

For every threat instance in `threat_model.md`, apply the following
decision logic IN ORDER:

```
Q1: Is the threat visible at tool invocation time as a structured field?
    YES → go to Q2
    NO  → assign layer = Out of OPA scope, go to STEP 3

Q2: Which structured field carries the evidence for this threat?
    Name it explicitly (e.g. input.arguments.keywords,
    input.extensions.subject.role).

Q3: Can a Rego rule deny the request based solely on that field?
    YES → assign layer = OPA
    NO  → assign layer = Out of OPA scope

For threats assigned Out of OPA scope:
Q4: Which layer CAN address it?
    - Agent layer: threats in LLM reasoning, system prompt, output text
    - Tool implementation: unsanitised output, external call construction
    - Infrastructure/deployment: dependency pinning, supply chain
    - N/A: not applicable to this tool
```

---

#### STEP 3 — Build the scoping table

Produce a table with one row per OWASP category (not per threat instance):

| OWASP Category | In OPA scope? | Scope note | Out-of-scope owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| ASI01 | Yes / Partial / No | <what OPA covers> | <layer for the rest> |
...

Partial = the category has both OPA-enforceable and non-enforceable
threat instances. Describe the split in the scope note.

---

#### STEP 4 — Build the gap register

For every out-of-scope item, record:

| Threat | Layer | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| <specific threat instance> | Agent / Tool impl / Infra | <one-line action> |

This register is for the teams responsible for those layers. It does not
feed into the OPA policy.

---

#### STEP 5 — Write OPA policy rules

For each threat assigned layer = OPA in STEP 2, write a concrete,
implementation-agnostic rule in plain English. Ground the rule in the
`mitigations` listed for that threat's ASI category in the catalog — pick
the mitigation(s) that are enforceable as a structured-field check, and use
them to justify the condition. Each rule must state:

- The condition to check (which field, what value or pattern)
- The violation code to emit on a match
- The severity (Hard block / Soft block)
- The matching semantics (exact / case-insensitive substring / numeric comparison)

Group rules by OWASP category. Do not write Rego — write requirements.

---

#### STEP 6 — Write owasp_policy_guidelines.md

Write the output file to `<TARGET_AGENT_PATH>/smith/guidelines-security-analysis/owasp_policy_guidelines.md`
using exactly this structure:

```
# OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI Security — Scope Assessment and Policy Guidelines
# Tool: <tool-name>

---

## Architecture Summary
<two-sentence description of the tool's layers and trust model,
 derived from architecture.md>

---

## OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI Security — Scope Assessment

### <Category name>
**Risk:** <one sentence>
**Verdict:** <In scope / Partial / Out of scope> — <one sentence reason>

[repeat for each category]

---

## Summary Table

| OWASP Category | In OPA scope? | Out-of-scope owner |
|---|---|---|
...

Categories flowing into the OPA policy: <comma-separated list>

---

## Gap Register

| Threat | Layer | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
...

---

## Policy Rules (OPA scope only)

### Input Schema
| Field | Source |
...

### Known values
[sets, enums, or term lists that rules reference]

### Rule: <violation code>
- OWASP: <category>
- Severity: Hard block / Soft block
- Condition: <plain-English condition>
- Matching: <exact / case-insensitive substring / numeric comparison>

[one block per violation code]

---

## Violation Code Reference

| Code | OWASP | Severity |
|---|---|---|
...
```

Do NOT include Rego code. Do NOT include OPA hints. The output is a
specification for policy generation, not an implementation.

---

#### STEP 7 — Human review

Present the summary table and the list of violation codes.

Log the summary table and violation code list, then continue automatically to the policy_writing skill.
